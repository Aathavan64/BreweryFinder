I was only able to spend around 6 hours on this project because of the tight deadline. It wasn’t the ideal amount of time as I didn’t have the chance to work on the UX/UI to the level I would have liked. As well the didn’t have time to make it fully accessible. Secondly I would have spend more time looking for a better API as this takes blank queries. There was no way of specifying what each particular parameter was filtering for. Wasn’t able to implement the needed tests.



To identify performance issues, I would look at various load to identify the threshold for the API. Caching requests would be a good way to improve API performance. This would reduce the number of requests in the instances there is a cached version available to the user.

I would improve the API by fixing the issues mentioned above. I would provide better query params, ideally one for state as well as city, instead of generic query searches.
